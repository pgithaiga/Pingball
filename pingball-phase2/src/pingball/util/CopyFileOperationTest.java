/**
 * The CopyFileOperation class was manually tested. 
 * 
 * We test this class by importing a file that is not located in the Boards Root 
 * directory. We make sure that:
 * 
 * A new file is created in the Boards Root directory with the same name as the file
 * chosen to be imported and that the file has the same content as the file chosen to
 * be imported
 * 
 * If a file with the same name as the file chosen to be imported already exists in the 
 * Boards Root directory, then the file is overwritten and now contains the same content
 * as the file chosen to be imported
